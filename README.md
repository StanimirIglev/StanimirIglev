### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Stan!

---

I am a cybersecurity student at Saarland University with focus on web security and automated software testing. More specifically, I am interested in program analysis, fuzzing, vulnerability detection and exploitation.

Along with my studies, I am working as a research assistant at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security. My current research is focused on developing tools for automated generation of highly-structured inputs.

Outside university and work, I enjoy learning new skills, experimenting with new languages and frameworks, as well as improving my penetration testing expertise.
